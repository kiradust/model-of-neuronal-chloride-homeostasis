abstract = {Over the past 25 years, successive cloning of SLC34A1, SLC34A2 and SLC34A3, which encode the sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate (Pi) cotransport proteins 2a–2c, has facilitated the identification of molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of renal and intestinal Pi transport. Pi and various hormones, including parathyroid hormone and phosphatonins, such as fibroblast growth factor 23, regulate the activity of these Pi transporters through transcriptional, translational and post-translational mechanisms involving interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins, lipid microdomains and acute trafficking of the transporters via endocytosis and exocytosis. In humans and rodents, mutations in any of the three transporters lead to dysregulation of epithelial Pi transport with effects on serum Pi levels and can cause cardiovascular and musculoskeletal damage, illustrating the importance of these transporters in the maintenance of local and systemic Pi homeostasis. Functional and structural studies have provided insights into the mechanism by which these proteins transport Pi, whereas in vivo and ex vivo cell culture studies have identified several small molecules that can modify their transport function. These small molecules represent potential new drugs to help maintain Pi homeostasis in patients with chronic kidney disease — a condition that is associated with hyperphosphataemia and severe cardiovascular and skeletal consequences.},

abstract = {3T3 cells were cultured in media with different phosphate concentrations and the effects on DNA synthesis were examined. Even a modest phosphate depletion markedly inhibited DNA synthesis and cell multiplication in proliferating cultures. Furthermore, the decrease in the proportion of DNA-synthesizing cells observed after phosphate starvation followed the same time-course as the decrease seen after serum starvation. Cells starved to quiescence in a medium with a 100-fold decrease in phosphate concentration remained viable but non-proliferating for up to 3 weeks, i.e. they had entered a state of quiescence comparable with that seen after serum starvation. Addition of phosphate to phosphate-depleted cultures restored DNA synthesis within 24 h. Furthermore, the kinetics of [3H]thymidine labelling after phosphate addition were nearly identical with the labelling kinetics following addition of serum to serum-depleted cultures. In contrast, phosphate deprivation had no inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis in simian-virus-40-transformed 3T3 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis in such cells caused by a complete removal of serum could not be further enhanced by decreasing the phosphate concentration in the culture medium. Phosphate ions have for some time been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation in vitro. One role suggested for phosphate has been to mediate the regulatory effects of serum and growth factors on DNA synthesis and cell division (Cunningham &},

During development, PNN formation terminates the critical period of neuroplasticity, a process that can be reversed by experimental disruption of PNNs. Perineuronal nets also regulate the intrinsic properties of the enclosed PV neurons thereby maintaining their inhibitory activity. Recent studies have implicated PNNs in central nervous system diseases as well as PV neuron dysfunction; consequently, they have further been associated with altered inhibition, particularly in the genesis of epilepsy. A wide range of seizure presentations in human and rodent models exhibit ECM remodeling with PNN disruption due to elevated protease activity. Inhibition of PNN proteolysis reduces seizure activity suggesting that PNN degrading enzymes may be potential novel therapeutic targets.},

The CDSPG was resolved from the HSPG by molecular sieve chromatography, which indicated that the molecular mass of the HSPG was greater than 300 kDa, while that of the CDSPG was approximately 50 kDa. Specific lyase digestion and urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis established the homogeneity of the CDSPG and suggested molecular masses of the core protein and glycosylated protein as 54 kDa and 58 kDa respectively. Virtually all of the poly-d-lysine substrate-bound proteoglycan-associated neurite growth-promoting activity of astrocyte CM was accounted for by the HSPG. On poly-d-lysine the immobilized CDSPG displayed little neurite growth-stimulatory activity relative to the HSPG. However, the CDSPG inhibited the potent growth-promoting activity of the HSPG by displacing it from the poly-d-lysine substrate. Differential cellular regulation of production of growth-modulatory proteins with different binding avidity for the substrate of growth may determine the success of a regenerative axonal response by fully competent neurons. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Sulfate is an important constituent of myelin membranes in the brain; however, very little is known as to how sulfate enters brain cells.

Injection of rat brain poly A+ RNA into Xenopus oocytes led to an induction of Na+-independent sulfate transport, which was inhibited by oxalate, probenecid, phenol red, thiosulfate and DIDS. Hybrid depletion using sat-1 antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides led to a complete inhibition of brain mRNA-induced sulfate transport in Xenopus oocytes, suggesting the presence of a functional sat-1 transcript in the brain. By RT-PCR, sat-1 mRNA was detected throughout the rat brain and in situ hybridisation showed highest sat-1 expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum.

PNNs restrict cortical network plasticity but the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. We found that reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex induced by chondroitinase ABC (chABC)-mediated PNN removal requires intact signaling by the neurotrophin receptor TRKB in PV+ neurons. Additionally, we demonstrate that chABC increases TRKB phosphorylation (pTRKB), while PNN component aggrecan attenuates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced pTRKB in cortical neurons in culture. We further found that protein tyrosine phosphatase r (PTP$\sigma$, PTPRS), receptor for CSPGs, interacts with TRKB and restricts TRKB phosphorylation. PTP$\sigma$ deletion increases phosphorylation of TRKB in vitro and in vivo in male and female mice, and juvenile-like plasticity is retained in the visual cortex of adult PTP$\sigma$-deficient mice (PTP$\sigma$+/-). The antidepressant drug fluoxetine, which is known to promote TRKB phosphorylation and reopen critical periodlike plasticity in the adult brain, disrupts the interaction between TRKB and PTP$\sigma$ by binding to the transmembrane domain of TRKB. We propose that both chABC and fluoxetine reopen critical period-like plasticity in the adult visual cortex by promoting TRKB signaling in PV+ neurons through inhibition of TRKB dephosphorylation by the PTP$\sigma$-CSPG complex.},

abstract = {Neuronal chloride concentration [Cl − ] i is an important determinant of GABA A receptor (GABA A R)-mediated inhibition and cytoplasmic volume regulation. Equilibrative cation-chloride cotransporters (CCC) move Cl − across the membrane, but accumulating evidence suggests factors other than the bulk concentrations of transported ions determine [Cl − ] i. Measurement of [Cl − ] i in murine brain slice preparations expressing the transgenic fluorophore Clomeleon demonstrated that cytoplasmic impermeant anions ([A] i) and polyanionic extracellular matrix glycoproteins ([A] o) constrain the local [Cl − ]. CCC inhibition had modest effects on [Cl − ] i and neuronal volume, but substantial changes were produced by alterations of the balance between [A] i and [A] o. Therefore, CCC are important elements of Cl − homeostasis, but local impermeant anions determine the homeostatic set-point for [Cl − ], and hence, neuronal volume and the polarity of local GABA A R signaling. The GABA A R can subserve either inhibition or excitation, because the net flux of the permeating anions HCO 3 − and Cl − can be reversed by modest changes in the transmembrane concentration gradient of Cl − (1, 2). NKCC1 and KCC2 are the primary cation-chloride co-transporters in neurons (3). Their unique stoichiometries result in distinct [Cl − ] i equilibria: $\sim$3 mM for KCC2 (4, 5) and $\sim$60 mM for NKCC1 (3). The species of cotransporter expressed in the neuron is thought to determine [Cl − ] i , but there is evidence that transporter expression is not the sole determinant of [Cl − ] i and hence, the reversal potential for GABA (E GABA). First, CCCs transport water along with cations and Cl − as nearly isotonic saline (6, 7). Neurons express no known aquaporin water channels (8), so the CCCs have limited capacity to alter [Cl − ] i independently of neuronal volume. Second, the transporter expressed may not correlate with the measured [Cl − ] i (9). Third, electrophysiological and fluorometric studies demonstrate a wide distribution of [Cl − ] i that rarely matches the equilibrium for},

Here we review the evidence that treatment with ChABC, either as an individual therapy or in combination with other strategies, can have multiple beneficial effects on promoting repair following spinal cord injury. These include promoting regeneration of injured axons, plasticity of uninjured pathways and neuroprotection of injured projection neurons. More importantly, ChABC therapy has been demonstrated to promote significant recovery of function to spinal injured animals. Thus, there is robust pre-clinical evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of ChABC treatment following spinal cord injury. Furthermore, these effects have been replicated in a number of different injury models, with independent confirmation by different laboratories, providing an important validation of ChABC as a promising therapeutic strategy. We discuss putative mechanisms underlying ChABC-mediated repair as well as potential issues and considerations in translating ChABC treatment into a clinical therapy for spinal cord injury. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Sulfate is the major sulfur source in many organisms, and because it is a hydrophilic anion that cannot passively cross the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, all cells require a mechanism for sulfate influx and efflux to ensure an optimal supply of sulfate in the body. The class of proteins involved in moving sulfate into or out of cells is called sulfate transporters. To date, numerous sulfate transporters have been identified in tissues and cells from many origins. These include the renal sulfate transporters NaSi-1 and sat-1, the ubiquitously expressed diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter DTDST, the intestinal sulfate transporter DRA that is linked to congenital chloride diarrhea, and the erythrocyte anion exchanger AE1. These transporters have only been isolated in the last 10-15 years, and their physiological roles and contributions to body sulfate homeostasis are just now beginning to be determined.

In this equation, two constants can be arbitrarily chosen:Ā, the sum of the charged and uncharged forms of dissociable fixed charges, andK, the dissociation constant of the fixed charges. For the present calculations, the previously obtained valuesĀ=2.5 andK=1{\textperiodcentered}10−9 were used. The resulting relationship between $$J_{SO_4 } $$ and SO 4 2− was found to obey the equation $$J_{SO_4 } = c_I \cdot \frac{{SO_{4m}^{2 - } }}{{c_{II} + SO_{4m}^{2 - } }}e^{aSO_{4m}^{2 - } } $$ wherec I=1.62{\textperiodcentered}10−9,c II=2.3{\textperiodcentered}10−2,a=4.94 gave the best fit for data obtained at 27°C. The exponential increase of $$J_{SO_4 } $$ with SO 4 2− suggests that there exists a cooperative facilitation of sulfate flux with increasing SO 4 2− . Measurements of the apparant activation energy of sulfate flux yielded a value of 32.7 Kcal/mole. This value was independent of the pH at which the measurements were made.},

abstract = {Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are an extracellular matrix structure rich in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which preferentially encase parvalbumin-containing (PV+) interneurons. PNNs restrict cortical network plasticity but the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. We found that reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex induced by chondroitinase ABC (chABC)-mediated PNN removal requires intact signaling by the neurotrophin receptor TRKB in PV+ neurons. Additionally, we demonstrate that chABC increases TRKB phosphorylation (pTRKB), while PNN component aggrecan attenuates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced pTRKB in cortical neurons in culture. We further found that protein tyrosine phosphatase $\sigma$ (PTP$\sigma$, PTPRS), receptor for CSPGs, interacts with TRKB and restricts TRKB phosphorylation. PTP$\sigma$ deletion increases phosphorylation of TRKB in vitro and in vivo in male and female mice, and juvenile-like plasticity is retained in the visual cortex of adult PTP$\sigma$-deficient mice (PTP$\sigma$+/−). The antidepressant drug fluoxetine, which is known to promote TRKB phosphorylation and reopen critical period-like plasticity in the adult brain, disrupts the interaction between TRKB and PTP$\sigma$ by binding to the transmembrane domain of TRKB. We propose that both chABC and fluoxetine reopen critical period-like plasticity in the adult visual cortex by promoting TRKB signaling in PV+ neurons through inhibition of TRKB dephosphorylation by the PTP$\sigma$-CSPG complex.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Critical period-like plasticity can be reactivated in the adult visual cortex through disruption of perineuronal nets (PNNs) by chondroitinase treatment, or by chronic antidepressant treatment. We now show that the effects of both chondroitinase and fluoxetine are mediated by the neurotrophin receptor TRKB in parvalbumin-containing (PV+) interneurons. We found that chondroitinase-induced visual cortical plasticity is dependent on TRKB in PV+ neurons. Protein tyrosine phosphatase $\sigma$ (PTP$\sigma$, PTPRS), a receptor for PNNs, interacts with TRKB and inhibits its phosphorylation, and chondroitinase treatment or deletion of PTP$\sigma$ increases TRKB phosphorylation. Antidepressant fluoxetine disrupts the interaction between TRKB and PTP$\sigma$, thereby increasing TRKB phosphorylation. Thus, juvenile-like plasticity induced by both chondroitinase and antidepressant treatment is mediated by TRKB activation in PV+ interneurons.},

Their mean resting membrane potential in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was ‐71 +/‐ 0.5 mV (+/‐ S.E.M.). The mean amplitude of the action potential was 84.0 +/‐ 1.4 mV (n = 50), and the mean input conductance was 101 +/‐ 7 nS (n = 49). 2. Both membrane potential and input conductance were sensitive to changes in [K+]o, [Na+]o, [Cl‐]o and [Ca2+]o. 3. Replacement of extracellular Ca2+ by Mn2+ resulted in less than 1 mV hyperpolarization and a decrease in input conductance from 102 +/‐ 7 to 93 +/‐ 6 nS (n = 15). 4. At high [K+]o (greater than 10 mM) the membrane potential followed the potential predicted by the Nernst equation for K+ ions with a slope of 58 mV per 10‐fold change in [K+]o. At low [K+]o (less than 10 mM) there was significant deviation from K+ equilibrium potential (EK). 5. [K+]i was found to be 106 mM when estimated from the reversal potential of the after‐hyperpolarization of the antidromic action potential. 6. The reversal potential of the recurrent inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in normal CSF was used to calculate [Cl‐]i. This was 6.6 mM, which is less than would be expected if Cl‐ was passively distributed, indicating the presence of an outwardly directed Cl‐ pump. 7. Decreasing [Cl‐]o from control (134 mM) to 4 mM resulted in a depolarization of 6.9 +/‐ 0.9 mV and a decrease in input conductance from 102 +/‐ 5 to 90 +/‐ 5 nS (n = 14) in 3 mM [K+]o. 8. Decreasing [Na+]o from 156 to 26 mM by substitution with choline resulted in a 6.2 +/‐ 0.5 mV hyperpolarization and a decrease in input conductance from from 102 +/‐ 4 to 76 +/‐ 4 nS (n = 5) in 3 mM [K+]o. 9. The input conductances for Na+, Cl‐ and K+ at the resting potential were calculated. After allowing for a microelectrode leak conductance, the relative input conductances were gNa/gK = 0.13 and gCl/gK = 0.25. {\textcopyright} 1988 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {Nonsynaptic mechanism changes, particularly the enhancement of NKCC1 expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) after 4 weeks of ethanol consumption, motivate the present work, in which rats were submitted to a period of chronic consumption (12 weeks). Four groups of six animals (6-week-old male Wistar rats) were formed, including the control (C), ethanol 1 (E1), ethanol 2 (E2) and ethanol 3 (E3) groups. The rats in the E1, E2 and E3 groups were treated daily with a 30% v/v solution of ethanol, administered via oral gavage (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 g/kg, respectively). Nonsynaptic epileptiform activities (NEA) were induced by means of the zero-Ca2+ and high-K+ model using hippocampal slices and were recorded in the DG. The presence of NKCC1, KCC2, $\alpha$1-Na+/K+-ATPase and GFAP immunoreactivity was analyzed. The results demonstrate that alcohol consumption changes NEA, and these changes are more prominent at the lower dosage. An increase in the DC shifts associated with epileptiform discharges was present with the low dose. This increase was correlated with the increment of NKCC1 expression. Confocal microscopy images indicate the NKCC1 increase was pronounced in the initial axonal segment of granule cells. The blockage of these cotransporters during NEA induction with bumetanide suppressed the DC shift increase and diminished all parameters of NEA that were quantified for all groups treated with ethanol. Therefore, the increase in NKCC1 expression and the effective activity of this cotransporter, which were observed in the treated groups, suggest that drugs that act for block NKCC1 represent promising strategies for diminishing the effects of alcohol damage on the brain.},

abstract = {KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-CI cotransporter, plays a major role in maintaining intracellular Cl concentration in neurons below its electrochemical equilibrium potential, thus favoring robust GABA hyperpolarizing or inhibitory responses. The pharmacology of the K-CI cotransporter is dominated by loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, molecules used in clinical medicine because they inhibit the loop of Henle Na-K-2CI cotransporter with much higher affinity. To identify molecules that affect KCC2 activity, we developed a fluorescence-based assay suitable for highthroughput screening (HTS) and used the assay to screen a library of 234,000 small molecules. We identified a large number of molecules that either decrease or increase the activity of the cotransporter. Here, we report the characterization of a small number of inhibitors, some of which inhibit KCC2 activity in the submicomolar range without substantially affecting NKCC1 activity. Using medicinal chemistry, we synthesized a number of variants, tested their effect on KCC2 function, and provide an analysis of structure/activity relationships. We also used one of the compounds to demonstrate competitive inhibition in regard to external [K +] versus noncompetitive inhibition in respect to external [Cl-].},

The brain ISS is a dynamic and complex space connecting the vascular system and neural networks and it plays crucial roles in substance transport and signal transmission among neurons. Investigation of the brain ISS can provide new perspectives for understanding brain architecture and function and for exploring new strategies to treat brain disorders. This review discussed the anatomy of the brain ISS under both physiological and pathological conditions, biophysical modeling of the brain ISS and in vivo measurement and imaging techniques, including recent findings on brain ISS divisions.

abstract = {It is well accepted that cotransporters facilitate water movement by two independent mechanisms: osmotic flow through a water channel in the protein and flow driven by ion/substrate cotransport. However, the molecular mechanism of transport-linked water flow is controversial. Some researchers believe that it occurs via cotransport, in which water is pumped along with the transported cargo, while others believe that flow is osmotic in response to an increase in intracellular osmolarity. In this letter, we report the results of a 200-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the sodium-dependent galactose cotransporter vSGLT. Our simulation shows that a significant number of water molecules cross the protein through the sugar-binding site in the presence as well as the absence of galactose, and 70-80 water molecules accompany galactose as it moves from the binding site into the intracellular space. During this event, the majority of water molecules in the pathway are unable to diffuse around the galactose, resulting in water in the inner half of the transporter being pushed into the intracellular space and replaced by extracellular water. Thus, our simulation supports the notion that cotransporters act as both passive water channels and active water pumps with the transported substrate acting as a piston to rectify the motion of water. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {To explore non-synaptic mechanisms in paroxysmal discharges, we used a computer model of a simplified hippocampal pyramidal cell, surrounded by interstitial space and a "glial-endothelial" buffer system. Ion channels for Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl-, ion antiport 3Na/Ca, and "active" ion pumps were represented in the neuron membrane. The glia had "leak" conductances and an ion pump. Fluxes, concentration changes and cell swelling were computed. The neuron was stimulated by injecting current. Afterdischarge (AD) followed stimulation if depolarization due to rising interstitial K+ concentration ([K+]o) activated persistent Na+ current (INa,P). AD was either simple or self-regenerating; either regular (tonic) or burst-type (clonic); and always self-limiting. Self-regenerating AD required sufficient INa,P to ensure re-excitation. Burst firing depended on activation of dendritic Ca2+ currents and Ca-dependent K+ current. Varying glial buffer function influenced [K+]o accumulation and afterdischarge duration. Variations in Na+ and K+ currents influenced the threshold and the duration of AD. The data show that high [K+]o and intrinsic membrane currents can produce the feedback of self-regenerating afterdischarges without synaptic input. The simulated discharge resembles neuron behavior during paroxysmal firing in living brain tissue. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of midbrain dopamine neurons has been developed to understand the mechanisms underlying two types of calcium-dependent firing patterns that these cells exhibit in vitro. The first is the regular, pacemaker-like firing exhibited in a slice preparation, and the second is a burst firing pattern sometimes exhibited in the presence of apamin. Because both types of oscillations are blocked by nifedipine, we have focused on the slow calcium dynamics underlying these firing modes. The underlying oscillations in membrane potential are best observed when action potentials are blocked by the application of TTX. This converts the regular single-spike firing mode to a slow oscillatory potential (SOP) and apamin-induced bursting to a slow square-wave oscillation. We hypothesize that the SOP results from the interplay between the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and the apamin- sensitive calcium-activated potassium current (I(K,Ca,SK)). We further hypothesize that the square-wave oscillation results from the alternating voltage activation and calcium inactivation of I(Ca.L). Our model consists of two components: a Hodgkin-Huxley-type membrane model and a fluid compartment model. A material balance on Ca2+ is provided in the cytosolic fluid compartment, whereas calcium concentration is considered constant in the extracellular compartment. Model parameters were determined using both voltage-clamp and calcium-imaging data from the literature. In addition to modeling the SOP and square-wave oscillations in dopaminergic neurons, the model provides reasonable mimicry of the experimentally observed response of SOPs to TEA application and elongation of the plateau duration of the square- wave oscillations in response to calcium chelation.},

abstract = {Sustained inward currents in neuronal membranes underlie tonicclonic seizure discharges and spreading depression (SD). It is not known whether these currents flow through abnormally operating physiological ion channels or through pathological pathways that are not normally present. We have now used the NEURON simulating environment of Hines, Moore, and Carnevale to model seizure discharges and SD. The geometry and electrotonic properties of the model neuron conformed to a hippocampal pyramidal cell. Voltage- controlled transient and persistent sodium currents (I(Na,T) and ((Na,P)), potassium currents (I(K,DR) and I(K,A)), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-controlled currents (I(NMDA)), were inserted in the appropriate regions of the model cell. The neuron was surrounded by an interstitial space where extracellular potassium and sodium concentration ([K+](o) and [Na+](o)) could rise or fall. Changes in intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and the resulting shifts in the driving force for ionic currents were continuously computed based on the amount of current flowing through the membrane. A Na-K exchange pump operated to restore ion balances. In addition, extracellular potassium concentration, [K+](o), was also controlled by a 'glial' uptake function. Parameters were chosen to resemble experimental data. As long as [K+](o) was kept within limits by the activity of the Na-K pump and the 'glial' uptake, a depolarizing current pulse applied to the cell soma evoked repetitive firing that ceased when the stimulating current stopped. If, however, [K+](o) was allowed to rise, then a brief pulse provoked firing that outlasted the stimulus. At the termination of such a burst, the cell hyperpolarized and then slowly depolarized and another burst erupted without outside intervention. Such 'clonic' bursting could continue indefinitely maintained by an interplay of the rise and fall of potassium and sodium concentrations with membrane currents and threshold levels. SD-like depolarization could be produced in two ways, 1) by a dendritic NMDA-controlled current. Glutamate was assumed to be released in response to rising [K+](o). And 2) by the persistent (i.e., slowly inactivating) Na-current, I(Na,P). When both I(NMDA) and I(Na,P) were present, the two acted synergistically. We conclude that epileptiform neuronal behavior and SD-like depolarization can be generated by the feedback of ion currents that change ion concentrations, which, in turn, influence ion currents and membrane potentials. The normal stability of brain function must depend on the efficient control of ion activities, especially that of [K+](o).},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal patterns of action potential initiations were studied in a behaving leech preparation to determine the basis of increased firing that accompanies sensitization, a form of non-associative learning requiring the S-interneurons. Little is known at the network level about mechanisms of behavioral sensitization. The S-interneurons, one in each ganglion and linked by electrical synapses with both neighbors to form a chain, are interposed between sensory and motor neurons. In sensitized preparations the strength of shortening is related to S-cell firing, which itself is the result of impulses initiating in several S-cells. Because the S-cells, as independent initiation sites, all contribute to activity in the chain, it was hypothesized that during sensitization, increased multi-site activity increased the chain's firing rate. However, it was found that during sensitization, the single site with the largest initiation rate, the S-cell in the stimulated segment, suppressed initiations in adjacent ganglia. Experiments showed this was both because (1) it received the earliest, greatest input and (2) the delayed synaptic input to the adjacent S-cells coincided with the action potential refractory period. A compartmental model of the S-cell and its inputs showed that a simple, intrinsic mechanism of inexcitability after each action potential may account for suppression of impulse initiations. Thus, a non-synaptic competition between neurons alters synaptic integration in the chain. In one mode, inputs to different sites sum independently, whereas in another, synaptic input to a single site precisely specifies the overall pattern of activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 IBRO.},

abstract = {1. We have developed a compartmental model of a turtle cerebellar granule cell consisting of 13 compartments that represent the soma and 4 dendrites. We used this model to investigate the synaptic integration of mossy fiber inputs in granule cells. 2. The somatic compartment contained six active ionic conductances: a sodium conductance with fast activation and inactivation kinetics, g(Na); a high-voltage-activated calcium conductance, g(Ca(HVA)); a delayed potassium conductance, g(K(DR)); a transient potassium conductance, g(K(A)); a slowly relaxing mixed Na+/K+ conductance activating at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, g(H), and a calcium- and voltage- dependent potassium conductance, g(K(Ca)). The kinetics of these conductances was derived from electrophysiological studies in a variety of preparations, including turtle and rat granule cells. 3. In the soma, dynamics of intracellular free Ca2+ was modeled by incorporation of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, radial diffusion, and binding sites for Ca2+. 4. The model of the turtle granule cell exhibited depolarization-induced action potential firing with properties closely resembling those seen with intracellular recordings in turtle granule cells in vitro. 5. In the most distal compartments of the dendrites, mossy fiber activity induced synaptic currents mediated by $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type of glutamate receptors. The strength of synaptic inputs chosen was such that the synaptic potential induced by synchronous activation of two mossy fiber synapses reached threshold for induction of a single action potential. 6. The slow time course of the NMDA synaptic current together with the slow relaxation kinetics of g(H) significantly affected the temporal summation of excitatory synaptic potentials. A priming action potential evoked by mossy fiber stimulation increased the maximal time interval between two synaptic potentials capable to reach again threshold for a subsequent action potential. This time interval then decreased in parallel with the decay of the NMDA synaptic current reached a minimum after 200 ms, and slowly recovered with reactivation of g(H). 7. Repetitive, steady activation of synaptic conductances by a single mossy fiber at different frequencies induced action potential firing with a sharp threshold at 12 Hz. Activity of a single or of several mossy fibers induced firing of the granule cell at a frequency close to that induced when the average synaptic current was directly injected into the cell. The mossy fiber activity-granule cell firing frequency curve was close to linear with a slope of about one-half for input frequencies ≤400 Hz. 8. The effects of Golgi cell inhibition on mossy fiber to granule cell transmission were studied by inserting constant Cl- [$\gamma$-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A))]-conductances proximal to the mossy fiber synapses. With small values of the tonic inhibitory conductance, the temporal summation of repetitive synaptic potentials generated from two mossy fiber inputs became more dependent on their interspike interval, with maximal efficacy for coinciding inputs. Higher values of the tonic inhibitory conductance caused a shift of the output frequency versus mossy fiber frequency curve towards higher input frequency values. These two effects, taken together, suggest that Golgi cell feed forward and feed backward inhibition results in an increased sensitivity of parallel fiber output on the timing of mossy fiber inputs impinging on a single granule cell. 9. We conclude that granule cells are electrotonically very compact; the NMDA component of mossy fiber excitatory postsynaptic potentials can play an important role in synaptic integration by favoring temporal summation of excitatory inputs, and Golgi cell inhibition is a powerful regulator of the sensitivity of parallel fiber output on the timing of mossy fiber inputs. These aspects of synaptic integration are relevant to the early processing of mossy fiber input by the cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {Extracellular potassium concentration, [K+]o, and intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i, rise during neuron excitation, seizures and spreading depression. Astrocytes probably restrain the rise of K+ in a way that is only partly understood. To examine the effect of glial K+ uptake, we used a model neuron equipped with Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- conductances, ion pumps and ion exchangers, surrounded by interstitial space and glia. The glial membrane was either "passive", incorporating only leak channels and an ion exchange pump, or it had rectifying K+ channels. We computed ion fluxes, concentration changes and osmotic volume changes. Increase of [K+]o stimulated the glial uptake by the glial 3Na/2K ion pump. The [K+]o flux through glial leak and rectifier channels was outward as long as the driving potential was outwardly directed, but it turned inward when rising [K+]o/[K+]i ratio reversed the driving potential. Adjustments of glial membrane parameters influenced the neuronal firing patterns, the length of paroxysmal afterdischarge and the ignition point of spreading depression. We conclude that voltage gated K+ currents can boost the effectiveness of the glial "potassium buffer" and that this buffer function is important even at moderate or low levels of excitation, but especially so in pathological states. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.},

abstract = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is also effective in the treatment of PD. The output fibers of the GPi that form the lenticular fasciculus pass in close proximity to STN DBS electrodes. In turn, both STN projection neurons and GPi fibers of passage represent possible therapeutic targets of DBS in the STN region. We built a comprehensive computational model of STN DBS in parkinsonian macaques to study the effects of stimulation in a controlled environment. The model consisted of three fundamental components: 1) a three-dimensional (3D) anatomical model of the macaque basal ganglia, 2) a finite element model of the DBS electrode and electric field transmitted to the tissue medium, and 3) multicompartment biophysical models of STN projection neurons, GPi fibers of passage, and internal capsule fibers of passage. Populations of neurons were positioned within the 3D anatomical model. Neurons were stimulated with electrode positions and stimulation parameters defined as clinically effective in two parkinsonian monkeys. The model predicted axonal activation of STN neurons and GPi fibers during STN DBS. Model predictions regarding the degree of GPi fiber activation matched well with experimental recordings in both monkeys. Only axonal activation of the STN neurons showed a statistically significant increase in both monkeys when comparing clinically effective and ineffective stimulation. Nonetheless, both neural targets may play important roles in the therapeutic mechanisms of STN DBS. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {1. We have developed compartmental models of guinea-pig medial vestibular nuclei neurons (MVNns). The structure and the parameters of the model cells were chosen to reproduce the responses of type A and type B MVNns as described in electrophysiological recordings. 2. Dynamics of membrane potentials were modeled in 46 and 61 branched electrical compartments for Type A and Type B MVNns, respectively. Each compartment was allowed to contain up to nine active ionic conductances: a fast inactivating sodium conductance, g(Na), a persistent sodium conductance, g(Nap), a low-voltage activated calcium conductance, g(Ca(LVA)), a high-voltage activated calcium conductance, g(Ca(HVA)), a fast-voltage activated potassium conductance, g(K(fast)), a slowly relaxing voltage activated potassium conductance, g(K(slow)), a fast transient potassium channel, g(K(A)), a slowly relaxing mixed sodium-potassium conductance activating at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, g(H), and a calcium-activated potassium conductance g(K(AHP)). The kinetics of these conductances were derived from voltage-clamp studies in a variety of preparations. Kinetic parameters as well as distribution and density of ion channels were adjusted to yield the reported electrophysiological behavior of medial vestibular neurons. 3. Dynamics of intracellular free [Ca2+](i) were modeled by inclusion of a Ca2+-pump and a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger for extrusion of calcium. Diffusion of calcium between submembraneous sites and the center of an electrical compartment was modeled by 25 and 6 shell-like chemical compartments for the cell body and the proximal dendrites, respectively. These compartments also contained binding sites for calcium. 4. The dynamics of active conductances were the same in both models except for g(K(fast)). This was necessary to achieve the different shape of spikes and of spike afterhyperpolarization in type A and type B MVNns. An intermediate depolarizing component of the spike afterhyperpolarization of type B neurons in part depended on their dendritic cable structure. 5. Variation of the low threshold calcium conductance, g(Ca(LVA)), shows that the ability to generate low-threshold spike bursts critically depends on the density of this conductance. Sodium plateaus were generated when increasing the density of g(Nap). 6. The type B model cell generated rhythmic bursts of spiking activity under simulation of two distinct experimental conditions. The first experimental condition was the inclusion in the dendritic compartments of a voltage-dependent conductance with properties replicating tonic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- type of glutamate receptors. The second paradigm was the reduction of the density of g(K(AHP)). The emergence of oscillatory firing under these two specific experimental conditions is consistent with electrophysiological recordings not used during construction of the model. We, therefore, suggest that these models have a high predictive value.},

abstract = {Traditionally, it is considered that neuronal synchronization in epilepsy is caused by a chain reaction of synaptic excitation. However, it has been shown that synchronous epileptiform activity may also arise without synaptic transmission. In order to investigate the respective roles of synaptic interactions and nonsynaptic mechanisms in seizure transitions, we developed a computational model of hippocampal cells, involving the extracellular space, realistic dynamics of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl-ions, glial uptake and extracellular diffusion mechanisms. We show that the network behavior with fixed ionic concentrations may be quite different from the neurons' behavior when more detailed modeling of ionic dynamics is included. In particular, we show that in the extended model strong discharge of inhibitory interneurons may result in long lasting accumulation of extracellular K+, which sustains the depolarization of the principal cells and causes their pathological discharges. This effect is not present in a reduced, purely synaptic network. These results point to the importance of nonsynaptic mechanisms in the transition to seizure.},

abstract = {1. The present investigation was undertaken to characterize the Na +/K + pump current in small (≤25 $\mu$m in soma diameter) dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons isolated from lumbar L4-6 segments of adult rats. 2. The Na +/K + pump current was identified as an ouabain-sensitive current during square voltage steps to membrane potentials between +40 and -120 mV, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in which Ca 2+ and K + channel currents and Na +/C a2+ exchange currents were minimized. The Na +/K + pump current was practically time-independent over the entire voltage range examined and exhibited a voltage-dependence; its current - voltage (I-D relationship displayed a positive slope at potentials between -120 and 0 mV but nearly plateau levels at positive membrane potentials. 3. The concentration-dependent block of Na +/K + pump current (activated by 30 mM pipette Na +) by ouabain at concentrations between 0.1 $\mu$M and 5 mM was biphasic and was well described using a two-binding site model with dissociation constants for high- and low-affinity binding sites of 0.20 and 140.1 $\mu$M, respectively. The relative amplitude of the Na +/K + pump current produced by low- and high-affinity sites (probably $\alpha$1$\beta$1 and $\alpha$3$\beta$1 isozymes, respectively) was estimated to be 13:1 in the presence of 30 mm Na + in the pipette solution. 4. Additionally, the activation of Na +/K + pump current by pipette Na + at concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 mM also exhibited a biphasic concentration dependence which can be reasonably well fitted by assuming the existence of two isozymes having high and low affinities for Na + (6.7 and 67.6 mM, respectively). 5. Thus, the present investigation provides functional evidence to suggest that the Na +/K + ATPase comprises two functionally distinct isozymes as expected for $\alpha$1$\beta$1 and $\alpha$3$\beta$1 in rat small DRG neurons.},

The onset of inhibition of the Na efflux was concentration‐dependent; but did not follow simple first order kinetics. The time course of inhibition was roughly exponential although in about 30% of the axons inhibition was preceded by a transient stimulation of the Na efflux. 3. Inhibition of the Na efflux by both ouabain and strophanthidin was apparently irreversible. 4. The onset of inhibition was slowed markedly at low temperatures. 5. Replacement of external Na by choline, dextrose or potassium slowed the rate of inhibition. Li behaved like Na and inhibition was faster in K‐ASW than in choline‐ASW. 6. The rate of inhibition of Na‐Na exchange was similar to that of Na‐K exchange, but ouabain failed to bind securely to fully poisoned axons. 7. Two components of [3H]ouabain‐binding could be distinguished. A linear component which probably reflects uptake into the cells and a saturable component which seems to reflect binding to Na‐pumping sites. 8. The saturable component of binding followed a similar time course to the inhibition of the Na efflux and the rate of binding was reduced in choline‐ASW and in fully poisoned axons. 9. Measurements of [3H]ouabain‐binding indicate that the number of Na pumping sites in the axon membrane is probably between 103 and 104/$\mu$2. {\textcopyright} 1972 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {Morphological reconstructions have become a routine and valuable tool for neuroscientists. The accuracy of reconstructions is a matter of considerable interest given that they are widely used in computational studies of neural function. Despite their wide usage, comparisons of reconstructions obtained using various methodologies are lacking. We reviewed reconstructions of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from five published studies and found marked differences in some of the most basic measurements. For four of the five studies means of total cell length clustered in the 11,479-13,417-$\mu$m range. The remaining study had a significantly larger value for this index at 16,992 ± 5,788 $\mu$m. Surface area means varied more than 4-fold from 16,074 to 67,102 $\mu$m2. Volume means varied more than 8-fold from 3,828 to 30,384 $\mu$m3. Simulated passive input resistance means varied from 38.0 to 172.1 M$\Omega$, reflecting the variability in cell dimensions. Estimates of the electrotonic length varied from 1.26 to 1.56. In two reconstructions used in previously published studies, simulated somatic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) varied 2-4-fold in amplitude, time to peak and half-width, for synaptic inputs at similar locations. Substantial jitter on the z-axis was identified as one likely source of the discrepancy in total cell length, while substantial differences in diameter measurements across studies, and sometimes within the same study, accounted for the variability in surface area and volume. While some part of the observed variability is surely due to the diversity of CA1 pyramidal cells, our analysis suggests that a substantial portion stemmed from methodological inconsistencies and from technological limitations. Suggestions are made for improving the quality and usefulness of morphological reconstructions. We conclude that reconstructions across studies have substantial variability in measures that are very relevant to neuronal function. Consequently, modelers are advised to use more than just one reconstructed cell in their simulations of neural function. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Vesicles were stressed by partial aspiration into parallel bore pipettes. The isotropic membrane tension so created caused an increase in membrane area which expresses itself in an elongation of the vesicle projection into the pipette. 3. For individual vesicles, a linear relationship between membrane tension and membrane area increase was found up to the point when the vesicle burst, i.e. sarcolemmal vesicles behaved as perfectly elastic structures. 4. The maximum tension sarcolemmal vesicles could sustain before bursting was 12.4 ± 0.2 mN m-1 (median ± 95% confidence interval), and the corresponding fractional increase in membrane area was 0.026 ± 0.005 (median ± 95% confidence interval). The elastic modulus of area expansion was 490 ± 88 mN m-1 (mean ± S.D.). 5.

abstract = {When neurons undergo dramatic shape and volume changes, how is surface area adjusted appropriately? The membrane tension hypothesis-namely that high tensions favor recruitment of membrane to the surface whereas low tensions favor retrieval-provides a simple conceptual framework for surface area homeostasis. With membrane tension and area in a feedback loop, tension extremes may be averted even during excessive mechanical load variations. We tested this by measuring apparent membrane tension of swelling and shrinking Lymnaea neurons. With hypotonic medium (50%), tension that was calculated from membrane tether forces increased from 0.04 to as much as 0.4 mN/m, although at steady state, swollen-cell tension (0.12 mN/m) exceeded controls only threefold. On reshrinking in isotonic medium, tension reduced to 0.02 mN/m, and at the substratum, membrane invaginated, creating transient vacuole-like dilations. Swelling increased membrane tension with or without BAPTA chelating cytoplasmic Ca2+, but with BAPTA, unmeasurably large (although not lytic) tension surges occurred in approximately two-thirds of neurons. Furthermore, in unarborized neurons voltage-clamped by perforated- patch in 50% medium, membrane capacitance increased 8%, which is indicative of increasing membrane area. The relatively damped swelling-tension responses of Lymnaea neurons (no BAPTA) were consistent with feedback regulation. BAPTA did not alter resting membrane tension, but the large surges during swelling of BAPTA-loaded neurons demonstrated that 50% medium was inherently treacherous and that tension regulation was impaired by subnormal cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. However, neurons did survive tension surges in the absence of Ca2+ signaling. The mechanism to avoid high-tension rupture may be the direct tension-driven recruitment of membrane stores.},

abstract = {The emerging technological revolution in genetically encoded molecular sensors and super-resolution imaging provides neuroscientists with a pass to the real-time nano-world. On this small scale, however, classical principles of electrophysiology do not always apply. This is in large part because the nanoscopic heterogeneities in ionic concentrations and the local electric fields associated with individual ions and their movement can no longer be ignored. Here, we review basic principles of molecular electrodiffusion in the cellular environment of organized brain tissue. We argue that accurate interpretation of physiological observations on the nanoscale requires a better understanding of the underlying electrodiffusion phenomena.},

abstract = {To investigate excitatory and inhibitory GABA actions in cortical neuronal networks, we present a novel optogenetic approach using a mouse knock-in line with conditional expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in GABAergic interneurons. During whole-cell recordings from hippocampal and neocortical slices from postnatal day (P) 2-P15 mice, photostimulation caused depolarization and excitation of interneurons and evoked barrages of postsynaptic GABAergic currents. Excitatory/inhibitory GABA actions on pyramidal cells were assessed by monitoring the alteration in the frequency of EPSCs during photostimulation of interneurons. We found that in slices from P2-P8 mice, photostimulation evoked an increase in EPSC frequency, whereas in P9 -P15 mice the response switched to a reduction in EPSC frequency, indicating a developmental excitatory-to-inhibitory switch in GABA actions on glutamatergic neurons. Using a similar approach in urethane-anesthetized animals in vivo, we found that photostimulation of interneurons reduces EPSC frequency at ages P3-P9. Thus, expression of ChR2 in GABAergic interneurons of mice enables selective photostimulation of interneurons during the early postnatal period, and these mice display a developmental excitatory-to-inhibitory switch in GABA action in cortical slices in vitro, but so far show mainly inhibitory GABA actions on spontaneous EPSCs in the immature hippocampus and neocortex in vivo.},

abstract = {Objective: Although benzodiazepines and other GABAA receptors allosteric modulators are used to treat neonatal seizures, their efficacy may derive from actions on subcortical structures. Side effects of benzodiazepines in nonseizing human neonates include myoclonus, seizures, and abnormal movements. Excitatory actions of GABA may underlie both side effects and reduced anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines. Neocortical organotypic slice cultures were used to study: (1) spontaneous cortical epileptiform activity during early development; (2) developmental changes in [Cl-]i and (3) whether diazepam's anticonvulsant effect correlated with neuronal [Cl-]i. Methods: Epileptiform activity in neocortical organotypic slice cultures was measured by field potential recordings. Cl- changes during development were assessed by multiphoton imaging of neurons transgenically expressing a Cl-sensitive fluorophore. Clinically relevant concentrations of diazepam were used to test the anticonvulsant effectiveness at ages corresponding to premature neonates through early infancy. Results: (1) Neocortical organotypic slices at days in vitro 5 (DIV5) exhibited spontaneous epileptiform activity. (2) Epileptiform event duration decreased with age. (3) There was a progressive decrease in [Cl-]i over the same age range. (4) Diazepam was ineffective in decreasing epileptiform activity at DIV5-6, but progressively more effective at older ages through DIV15. (5) At DIV5-6, diazepam worsened epileptiform activity in 50% of the slices. Interpretation: The neocortical organotypic slice is a useful model to study spontaneous epileptiform activity. Decreasing [Cl-]i during development correlates with decreasing duration of spontaneous epileptiform activity and increasing anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam. We provide a potential explanation for the reports of seizures and myoclonus induction by benzodiazepines in newborn human neonates and the limited electrographic efficacy of benzodiazepines for the treatment of neonatal seizures.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

Our model contains Hodgkin—Huxley-type ion currents, a recently discovered voltage-gated chloride flux through the ion exchanger SLC26A11, active KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion, and ATP-dependent pumps. The model predicts changes in ion gradients and cell swelling during ischemia of various severity or channel blockage with realistic timescales. We theoretically substantiate experimental observations of chloride influx generating cytotoxic edema, while sodium entry alone does not. We show a tipping point of Na+/K+-ATPase functioning, where below cell volume rapidly increases as a function of the remaining pump activity, and a Gibbs–Donnan-like equilibrium state is reached. This precludes a return to physiological conditions even when pump strength returns to baseline. However, when voltage-gated sodium channels are temporarily blocked, cell volume and membrane potential normalize, yielding a potential therapeutic strategy.},

We used Cl- imaging to study the [Cl-]i vs. the distance from the cut surface in acute thalamocortical slices from mice at developmental ages ranging from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P20. We demonstrate: 1) [Cl-]i is higher in the most superficial areas in both neocortical and thalamic brain slices at all ages tested and, 2) there is a developmental decrease in [Cl-]i that is independent of acute trauma caused by brain slicing. We conclude that [Cl-]i has a developmental progression during P5-20 in both the neocortex and thalamus. However, in both brain regions and during development the neurons closest to the slicing trauma have an elevated [Cl-]i.},

abstract = {Energy deficiency and dysfunction of the Na+, K+-ATPase are common consequences of many pathological insults. The nature and mechanism of cell injury induced by impaired Na+, K+-ATPase, however, are not well defined. We used cultured cortical neurons to examine the hypothesis that blocking the Na+, K+-ATPase induces apoptosis by depleting cellular K+ and, concurrently, induces necrotic injury in the same cells by increasing intracellular Ca2+ and Na+. The Na+, K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain induced concentration-dependent neuronal death. Ouabain triggered transient neuronal cell swelling followed by cell shrinkage, accompanied by intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ increase, K+ decrease, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and DNA laddering. Electron microscopy revealed the coexistence of ultrastructural features of both apoptosis and necrosis in individual cells. The caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) blocked >50% of ouabain-induced neuronal death. Potassium channel blockers or high K+ medium, but not Ca2+ channel blockade, prevented cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA damage. Blocking of K+, Ca2+, or Na+ channels or high K+ medium each attenuated the ouabain-induced cell death; combined inhibition of K+ channels and Ca2+ or Na+ channels resulted in additional protection. Moreover, coapplication of Z-VAD-FMK and nifeclipine produced virtually complete neuroprotection. These results suggest that the neuronal death associated with Na+, K+-pump failure consists of concurrent apoptotic and necrotic components, mediated by intracellular depletion of K+ and accumulation of Ca2+ and Na+, respectively. The ouabain-induced hybrid death may represent a distinct form of cell death related to the brain injury of inadequate energy supply and disrupted ion homeostasis.},

abstract = {During postnatal development of the rat hippocampus, $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) switches its action on CA3 pyramidal cells from excitatory to inhibitory. To characterize the underlying changes in the GABA reversal potential, we used somatic cell-attached recordings of GABA(A) and N-methyl-d-aspartate channels to monitor the GABA driving force and resting membrane potential, respectively. We found that the GABA driving force is strongly depolarizing during the first postnatal week. The strength of this depolarization rapidly declines with age, although GABA remains slightly depolarizing, by a few millivolts, even in adult neurons. Reduction in the depolarizing GABA driving force was due to a progressive negative shift of the reversal potential of GABA currents. Similar postnatal changes in GABA signalling were also observed using the superfused hippocampus preparation in vivo, and in the hippocampal interneurons in vitro. We also found that in adult pyramidal cells, somatic GABA reversal potential is maintained at a slightly depolarizing level by bicarbonate conductance, chloride-extrusion and chloride-loading systems. Thus, the postnatal excitatory-to-inhibitory switch in somatic GABA signalling is associated with a negative shift of the GABA reversal potential but without a hyperpolarizing switch in the polarity of GABA responses. These results also suggest that in adult CA3 pyramidal cells, somatic GABAergic inhibition takes place essentially through shunting rather than hyperpolarization. Apparent hyperpolarizing GABA responses previously reported in the soma of CA3 pyramidal cells are probably due to cell depolarization during intracellular or whole-cell recordings. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2008).},

abstract = {The ability of all cells to set and regulate their size is a fundamental aspect of cellular physiology. It has been known for sometime but not widely so, that size stability in animal cells is dependent upon the operation of the sodium pump, through the so-called pump-leak mechanism (Tosteson and Hoffman, 1960). Impermeant molecules in cells establish an unstable osmotic condition, the Donnan effect, which is counteracted by the operation of the sodium pump, creating an asymmetry in the distribution of Na+ and K+ staving offwater inundation. In this paper, which is in part a tutorial, I show how to model quantitatively the ion and water fluxes in a cell that determine the cell volume and membrane potential. The movement of water and ions is constrained by both osmotic and charge balance, and is driven by ion and voltage gradients and active ion transport. Transforming these constraints and forces into a set of coupled differential equations allows us to model how the ion distributions, volume and voltage change with time. I introduce an analytical solution to these equations that clarifies the influence of ion conductances, pump rates and water permeability in this multidimensional system. I show that the number of impermeant ions (x) and their average charge have a powerful influence on the distribution of ions and voltage in a cell. Moreover, I demonstrate that in a cell where the operation of active ion transport eliminates an osmotic gradient, the size of the cell is directly proportional to x. In addition, I use graphics to reveal how the physico-chemical constraints and chemical forces interact with one another in apportioning ions inside the cell. The form of model used here is applicable to all membrane systems, including mitochondria and bacteria, and I show how pumps other than the sodium pump can be used to stabilize cells. Cell biologists may think of electrophysiology as the exclusive domain of neuroscience, however the electrical effects of ion fluxes need to become an intimate part of cell biology if we are to understand a fundamental process like cell size regulation.},

abstract = {A brain slice preparation was used to study the hypoglossal (XII) neuronal response to anoxia. Both intra- and extracellular potassium activities (K+(i), K+(o)) were measured by the use of ion-selective microelectrodes, and K+ flux was assessed by the use of pharmacologic blockers. Extracellular recordings showed that a short period of anoxia (4 min) induced an increase in K+(o) of 26.4 ± 7.5 mM (mean ± SD, n = 20) in the XII nucleus of adult rats. Intracellular recordings (n = 31) in XII neurons showed a substantial decrease in K+(i) during anoxia. Fourteen neurons were analyzed in detail and these showed that XII neurons depolarized to -25.3 ± 7.7 mV, whereas K+(i) dropped from 93.6 ± 14.9 to 32 ± 9.0 mM. These results strongly suggested that K+ is lost from XII neurons during anoxia. Although the extracellular space (ECS) shrank by $\sim$50% during anoxia, the possibility that the increase in K+(o) and decrease in K+(i) were mainly caused by shrinkage of the ECS and swelling of intraneuronal space was excluded to a great degree because the changes in K+(i) and K+(o) during anoxia were relatively very large. To study the mechanisms by which K+ is lost from XII neurons, we used several pharmacologic blockers. High concentration of ouabain (10 mM) and strophanthidin (80 $\mu$M) increased K+(o) from baseline (3-4 mM) to 40.9 ± 2.5 mM (n = 6) but did not abolish an additional anoxia-induced increase in K+(o), suggesting that mechanisms other than Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase inhibition were also responsible for the anoxia-induced K+ leakage. Glibenclamide and tolbutamide, two specific ATP-sensitive K+ channel blockers, prevented a substantial amount of K+ loss during anoxia with a dose-dependent response, whereas apamin had no effect, suggesting that anoxia-induced K+ loss from XII neurons is related to the activation of ATP-sensitive but not Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. Tetrodotoxin and CoCl2, used to block synaptic transmission, decreased K+(o) accumulation, indicating that K+ loss is also related to increased neuronal activity during anoxia. Intracellular recordings of membrane potential showed that the anoxia-induced depolarization in XII neurons was significantly enhanced by 25% when the perfusate contained glibenclamide (40 $\mu$M), demonstrating that activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels during anoxia can limit the depolarization in XII neurons. We conclude that during anoxia XII neurons lose their cytosolic K+, which substantially contributes to the increase in K+(o); loss of neuronal intracellular K+ is mediated to a large degree by the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in XII neurons.},

abstract = {A major unresolved issue in treating pain is the paradoxical hyperalgesia produced by the gold-standard analgesic morphine and other opiates. We found that hyperalgesia-inducing treatment with morphine resulted in downregulation of the K+-Cl- co-transporter KCC2, impairing Cl- homeostasis in rat spinal lamina l neurons. Restoring the anion equilibrium potential reversed the morphine-induced hyperalgesia without affecting tolerance. The hyperalgesia was also reversed by ablating spinal microglia. Morphine hyperalgesia, but not tolerance, required $\mu$ opioid receptor-dependent expression of P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) in microglia and $\mu$-independent gating of the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by P2X4Rs. Blocking BDNF-TrkB signaling preserved Cl- homeostasis and reversed the hyperalgesia. Gene-targeted mice in which Bdnf was deleted from microglia did not develop hyperalgesia to morphine. However, neither morphine antinociception nor tolerance was affected in these mice. Our findings dissociate morphine-induced hyperalgesia from tolerance and suggest the microglia-to-neuron P2X4-BDNF-KCC2 pathway as a therapeutic target for preventing hyperalgesia without affecting morphine analgesia. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

Efficient KCC2 transport is essential for setting the neuronal Cl- gradient, which is required for fast GABAergic inhibition. Neto2 is required to maintain the normal abundance of KCC2 in neurons, and increases KCC2 function by binding to the active oligomeric form of this cotransporter. In the present study, we characterized GABAergic inhibition and KCC2-mediated neuronal chloride homeostasis in pyramidal neurons from adult hippocampal slices. Using gramicidin perforated patch clamp recordings we found that the reversal potential for GABA (EGABA) was significantly depolarized. We also observed that surface levels of KCC2 and phosphorylation of KCC2 serine 940 (Ser940) were reduced in Neto2-/-neurons compared to wild-type controls. To examine GABAergic inhibition we recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and found that Neto2-/- neurons had significant reductions in both their amplitude and frequency. Based on the critical role of Neto2 in regulating GABAergic inhibition we rationalized that Neto2-null mice would be prone to seizure activity. We found that Neto2-null mice demonstrated a decrease in the latency to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and an increase in seizure severity.},

abstract = {KCC2 is a neuron-specific K+-Cl-co-transporter that maintains a low intracellular Cl-concentration that is essential for hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by GABA A receptors. Deficits in KCC2 activity occur in disease states associated with pathophysiological glutamate release. However, the mechanisms by which elevated glutamate alters KCC2 function are unknown. The phosphorylation of KCC2 residue Ser940 is known to regulate its surface activity. We found that NMDA receptor activity and Ca 2+influx caused the dephosphorylation of Ser940 in dissociated rat neurons, leading to a loss of KCC2 function that lasted longer than 20 min. Protein phosphatase 1 mediated the dephosphorylation events of Ser940 that coincided with a deficit in hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition resulting from the loss of KCC2 activity. Blocking dephosphorylation of Ser940 reduced the glutamate-induced downregulation of KCC2 and substantially improved the maintenance of hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition. Reducing the downregulation of KCC2 therefore has therapeutic potential in the treatment of neurological disorders. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fast synaptic inhibition relies on tight regulation of intracellular Cl-. Chloride dysregulation is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Beyond mere disinhibition, the consequences of Cl- dysregulation are multifaceted and best understood in terms of a dynamical system involving complex interactions between multiple processes operating on many spatiotemporal scales. This dynamical perspective helps explain many unintuitive manifestations of Cl- dysregulation. Here we discuss how taking into account dynamical regulation of intracellular Cl- is important for understanding how synaptic inhibition fails, how to best detect that failure, why Cl- regulation is energetically so expensive, and the overall consequences for therapeutics.},

abstract = {The resting potential of identified cells (Parker cells) in the abdominal ganglion of Elysia chlorotica (Gould) depolarizes by about 30 mV in response to a 50% reduction in osmolality and returns to the original potential in 20 min. Cell volume recovery requires approximately 2 h. Thus, recovery of the resting potential is not dependent on recovery of cell volume. The hypo-osmotic depolarization persists following inhibition of the electrogenic Na+/K(+)-ATPase with ouabain, and the levels of extracellular K+ and Cl- have little effect on the magnitude of the depolarization, while decreasing extracellular Na+ concentration produces a depolarization of only 10 mV. This suggests that the hypo-osmotic depolarization in Parker cells results mostly from increased relative permeability to Na+. Following transfer from 920 to 460 mosmol kg-1, Na+, Cl- and proline betaine leave the cells while intracellular K+ is conserved. Loss of intracellular Na+ and conservation of intracellular K+ are dependent on active transport by the Na+/K(+)-ATPase. Na+ and proline betaine leave the cells with a time course that is much longer than that of the hypo-osmotic depolarization. Unlike the other solutes, most of the reduction in intracellular Cl- concentration occurs coincidentally with the hypo-osmotic depolarization. However, unlike the hypo-osmotic depolarization, bulk loss of Cl- does not require the reduction in osmolality, only the reduction in extracellular ion concentrations. There is no apparent relationship between membrane depolarization and the regulation of intracellular osmolytes in Elysia neurons following hypo-osmotic stress.},

abstract = {We measured the osmotic pressure of diffusible myoplasmic proteins in frog (Rana temporaria) skeletal muscle fibers by using single Sephadex beads as osmometers and dialysis membranes as protein filters. The state of the myoplasmic water was probed by determining the osmotic coefficient of parvalbumin, a small, abundant diffusible protein distributed throughout the fluid myoplasm. Tiny sections of membrane (3.5- and 12-14-kDa cutoffs) were juxtaposed between the Sephadex beads and skinned semitendinosus muscle fibers under oil. After equilibration, the beads were removed and calibrated by comparing the diameter of each bead to its diameter measured in solutions containing 3-12% Dextran T500 (a long-chain polymer). The method was validated using 4% agarose cylinders loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or parvalbumin. The measured osmotic pressures for 1.5 and 3.0 mM BSA were similar to those calculated by others. The mean osmotic pressure produced by the myoplasmic proteins was 9.7 mOsm (4°C). The osmotic pressure attributable to parvalbumin was estimated to be 3,4 mOsm. The osmotic coefficient of the parvalbumin in fibers is ∼3.7 mOsm mM--1, i.e., roughly the same as obtained from parvalbumin-loaded agarose cylinders under comparable conditions, suggesting that the fluid interior of muscle resembles a simple salt solution as in a 4% agarose gel.},

abstract = {1. Identified neurones of the suboesophageal ganglia of Helix aspersa were loaded with tetramethylammonium (TMA+). Experimentally induced changes in cell water volume and membrane potential were measured continuously by monitoring changes in intracellular [TMA+] using ion‐sensitive double‐barrelled microelectrodes. The technique allowed measurements of cell water volume changes of less than 5%. 2. Exposure to hyperosmotic (up to +24%) or hyposmotic (up to about ‐10%) solutions caused reversible decreases and increases in cell water volume respectively, which agreed with near‐ideal osmometric behaviour. Upon exposure to hyposmotic solutions whose osmolality was decreased by 30‐40%, the cell water volume increased to maximum values below those expected for ideal osmometric behaviour and exhibited partial regulatory volume decrease. 3. The sodium pump was inhibited in twenty identified neurones by sustained exposure to 1 mM ouabain. In every case ouabain caused cell membrane depolarization, as expected for inhibition of an electrogenic sodium pump. 4. Upon pump inhibition most cells (n = 14) shrank by up to 13% of their initial water volume. In five of these cells, shrinkage was preceded by one or more short‐lived swelling phases. In two other neurones short‐lived swelling was followed by cell volume recovery without appreciable shrinkage. In four out of the twenty cells, there were no measurable volume changes. 5. The lack of an initial swelling phase in the cells that shrank, as well as the absence of detectable volume changes in some of the neurones, was not due to loss of ion‐selective electrode sensitivity since predictable changes in cell volume elicited by osmotic challenges were monitored in the same cells. 6. It is concluded that neurones can be endowed with ouabain‐insensitive mechanisms of volume control, whose activation following Na+ pump inhibition prevents them from short‐term swelling and lysis. {\textcopyright} 1992 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {By using electrophysiological and microfluorimetric methods, we found that leech Retzius neurons swell after inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump by the cardiac glycoside ouabain. To explore the mechanism of this swelling, we measured the effect of ouabain on [Na+]i, [K+]i, and [Cl-]i, as well as on the membrane potential, by applying triple-barrelled ion-sensitive microelectrodes. As shown previously, ouabain induced a marked [Na+]i increase, a [K+]i decrease, and a membrane depolarization, and it also evoked an increase in [Cl-]i. The analysis of the data revealed a net uptake of NaCl, which quantitatively explained the ouabain-induced cell swelling. In the absence of extracellular Na+ or Cl-, NaCl uptake was excluded, and the cell volume remained unaffected. Likewise, NaCl uptake and, hence, cell swelling did not occur when the Na+-K+ pump was inhibited by omitting bath K +. Also, in K+-free solution, [Na+]i increased and [K+]i dropped, but [Cl-] i slightly decreased, and after an initial, small membrane depolarization, the cells hyperpolarized for a prolonged period. It is concluded that the ouabain-induced NaCl uptake is caused by the depolarization of the plasma membrane, which augments the inwardly directed electrochemical Cl - gradient. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Since then, four distinct KCCs have been cloned, and their importance for volume regulation has been demonstrated in other cell types. Genetic models of certain KCCs, such as KCC3, and their inhibitory WNK-STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) serine-threonine kinases, have demonstrated the evolutionary necessity of these molecules for nervous system cell volume regulation, structure, and function, and their involvement in neurological disease. The recent characterization of a swelling-activated dephosphorylation mechanism that potently stimulates the KCCs has pinpointed a potentially druggable switch of KCC activity. An improved understanding of WNK/SPAK-mediated KCC cell volume regulation in the nervous system might reveal novel avenues for the treatment of multiple neurological diseases.},

abstract = {Functional brain imaging technologies have enabled recent advances in understanding human brain function. In particular, a noninvasive and fast optical technique will become one of the most promising tools for future studies. As a fundamental ex vivo study for the development of such a technique, this paper demonstrates the spectral measurement of fast optical changes associated with neural activity in bulk brain tissue. For this purpose, a high-speed confocal near-infrared spectrometer was built and used. The results verified that observed transient optical responses (tORs) are associated with neural activity by showing that the following: tORs were concurrent and correlated with local field potentials (LFPs); tORs disappeared following tetrodotoxin application; and tORs were reproducibly observed across preparations. In addition, the amplitude of tORs was statistically significantly larger in longer wavelengths ($\sim$ 1200. nm). The time course of tORs, however, is quite different from that of LFPs. Since this difference implies that tORs may originate not directly from the electric potential variation but from other neurophysiological events accompanying excitation, this paper tested the hypothesis that tORs are attributed to transient cellular volume changes (tCVCs). With no previous dynamic equation to elucidate such different temporal dynamics of the optical responses, a novel mathematical neuron model to describe tCVCs was developed. This neuron model, along with finite-difference time-domain simulations, showed that tCVCs and tORs were similar in the temporal dynamics, order of magnitude, response direction, and detectability in the bulk tissue; thus supporting the hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The membrane potential (Em) is a fundamental cellular parameter that is primarily determined by the transmembrane permeabilities and concentration gradients of various ions. However, ion gradients are themselves profoundly influenced by Em due to its influence upon transmembrane ion fluxes and cell volume (Vc). These interrelationships between Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations make computational modelling useful or necessary in order to guide experimentation and to achieve an integrated understanding of experimental data, particularly in complex, dynamic, multi-compartment systems such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes. A variety of quantitative techniques exist that may assist such understanding, from classical approaches such as the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium, to more recent "current-summing" models as exemplified by cardiac myocyte models including those of DiFrancesco & Noble, Luo & Rudy and Puglisi & Bers, or the "charge-difference" modelling technique of Fraser & Huang so far applied to skeletal muscle. In general, the classical approaches provide useful and important insights into the relationships between Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations at steady state, providing their core assumptions are fully understood, while the more recent techniques permit the modelling of changing values of Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations. The present work therefore reviews the various approaches that may be used to calculate Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations with the aim of establishing the requirements for an integrated model that can both simulate dynamic systems and recapitulate the key findings of classical techniques regarding the cellular steady state. At a time when the number of cellular models is increasing at an unprecedented rate, it is hoped that this article will provide a useful and critical analysis of the mathematical techniques fundamental to each of them. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. During prolonged activation of dendritic GABA(A) receptors, the postsynaptic membrane response changes from hyperpolarization to depolarization. One explanation for the change in direction of the response is that opposing HCO3- and Cl- fluxes through the GABA(A) ionophore diminish the electrochemical gradient driving the hyperpolarizing Cl- flux, so that the depolarizing HCO3- flux dominates. Here we demonstrate that the necessary conditions for this mechanism are present in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites. 2. Prolonged GABA(A) receptor activation in low-HCO3- media decreased the driving force for dendritic but not somatic Cl- currents. Prolonged GABA(A) receptor activation in low-Cl- media containing physiological HCO3- concentrations did not degrade the driving force for dendritic or somatic HCO3- gradients. 3. Dendritic Cl- transport was measured in three ways: from the rate of recovery of GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents between paired dendritic GABA(A) applications, from the rate of recovery between paired synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents, and from the predicted vs. actual increase in synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents at progressively more positive test potentials. These experiments yielded estimates of the maximum transport rate (v(max) for Cl- transport of 5 to 7 mmol l-1 s-1, and indicate that v(max) could be exceeded by GABA(A) receptor-mediated Cl- influx. 4. The affinity of the Cl- transporter was calculated in experiments in which the reversal potential for Cl- (E(Cl)) was measured from the GABA(A) reversal potential in low-HCO3- media during Cl- loading from the recording electrode solution. The calculated K(D) was 15 mM. 5. Using a standard model of membrane potential, these conditions are demonstrated to be sufficient to produce the experimentally observed, activity-dependent GABA(A) depolarizing response in pyramidal cell dendrites.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this work is to study, by means of computational simulations, the induction and sustaining of nonsynaptic epileptiform activity. Methods: The computational model consists of a network of cellular bodies of neurons and glial cells connected to a three-dimensional (3D) network of juxtaposed extracellular compartments. The extracellular electrodiffusion calculation was used to simulate the extracellular potential. Each cellular body was represented in terms of the transmembrane ionic transports (Na +/K+ pumps, ionic channels, and cotransport mechanisms), the intercellular electrodiffusion through gap-junctions, and the neuronal interaction by electric field and the variation of cellular volume. Results: The computational model allows simulating the nonsynaptic epileptiform activity and the extracellular potential captured the main feature of the experimental measurements. The simulations of the concomitant ionic fluxes and concentrations can be used to propose the basic mechanisms involved in the induction and sustaining of the activities. Discussion: The simulations suggest: The bursting induction is mediated by the Cl- Nernst potential overcoming the transmembrane potential in response to the extracellular [K+] increase. The burst onset is characterized by a critical point defined by the instant when the Na+ influx through its permeable ionic channels overcomes the Na+/K+ pump electrogenic current. The burst finalization is defined by another critical point, when the electrogenic current of the Na+/K+ pump overcomes its influx through the channels. {\textcopyright} 2008 International League Against Epilepsy.},

abstract = {The brain's cerebral cortex is folded into intricate patterns of gyri (hills) and sulci (valleys). The complete biological mechanism underlying the cortical folding process continues to remain elusive to this day. One proposed biological mechanism of cortical folding is the Intermediate Progenitor Model, which correlates patterns of regional self-amplification of neural intermediate progenitor cells with cortical folds. We construct mathematical models of cortical folding utilizing a Turing reaction-diffusion system on an exponentially or logistically growing prolate spheroidal domain. Patterns generated by our Turing system models represent prepatterns for regional activation of self-amplification of intermediate progenitor cells, which may be correlated with cortical folding patterns according to the Intermediate Progenitor Model. We observe that the presence of exponential domain growth generates a Turing pattern that is continually transient and evolves from one pattern to another. This differs from patterns generated by a static domain Turing system, which converge to a final pattern. We also observe that a logistically growing domain Turing system generates a pattern that is transient during the period of rapid domain growth, but then converges to a final pattern similar to a static domain Turing system. Our Turing models of cortical folding can be used to explain certain diseases of cortical folding. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The expression level of the neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) is a major determinant of whether neurons will respond to GABA with a depolarizing, excitatory response or a hyperpolarizing, inhibitory response. In view of the potential role in human neuronal excitability we have characterized the hKCC2 cDNA and gene. The 5.9 kb hKCC2 transcript is specific to brain, and is induced during in vitro differentiation of NT2 teratocarcinoma cells into neuronal NT2-N cells. The 24-exon SLC12A5 gene is on human chromosome 20q13, and contains a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat within intron 1 near a potential binding site for neuron-restrictive silencing factor. Expression of hKCC2 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes results in significant Cl--dependent 86Rb+ uptake under isotonic conditions; cell swelling under hypotonic conditions causes a 20-fold activation, which is blocked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A. In contrast, oocytes expressing mouse KCC4 do not mediate isotonic K-Cl cotransport but express much higher absolute transport activity than KCC2 oocytes under hypotonic conditions. Initial and steady state kinetics of hKCC2-injected oocytes were performed in both isotonic and hypotonic conditions, revealing Kms for K+ and Cl- of 9.3±1.8 mM and 6.8±0.9 mM, respectively; both affinities are significantly higher than KCC1 and KCC4. The Km for Cl- is close to the intracellular Cl- activity of mature neurons, as befits a neuronal efflux mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper quantifies recent experimental results through a general physical description of the mechanisms that might control two fundamental cellular parameters, resting potential (Em) and cell volume (Vc), thereby clarifying the complex relationships between them. Em was determined directly from a charge difference (CD) equation involving total intracellular ionic charge and membrane capacitance (Cm). This avoided the equilibrium condition dEm/dt = 0 required in determinations of Em by previous work based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and its derivatives and thus permitted precise calculation of Em even under non-equilibrium conditions. It could accurately model the influence upon Em of changes in Cm or Vc and of membrane transport processes such as the Na+-K+-ATPase and ion cotransport. Given a stable and adequate membrane Na+-K+-ATPase density (N), Vc and Em both converged to unique steady-state values even from sharply divergent initial intracellular ionic concentrations. For any constant set of transmembrane ion permeabilities, this set point of Vc was then determined by the intracellular membrane-impermeant solute content (X-i) and its mean charge valency (zX), while in contrast, the set point of Em was determined solely by zX. Independent changes in membrane Na+ (PNa) or K+ permeabilities (PK) or activation of cation-chloride cotransporters could perturb Vc and Em but subsequent reversal of such changes permitted full recovery of both Vc and Em to the original set points. Proportionate changes in PNa, PK and N, or changes in Cl- permeability (PCl) instead conserved steady-state Vc and Em but altered their rates of relaxation following any discrete perturbation. PCl additionally determined the relative effect of cotransporter activity on Vc and Em, in agreement with recent experimental results. In contrast, changes in Xi- produced by introduction of a finite permeability term to X- (PX) that did not alter zX caused sustained changes in Vc that were independent of Em and that persisted when PX returned to zero. Where such fluxes also altered the effective zX they additionally altered the steady state Em. This offers a basis for the suggested roles of amino acid fluxes in long-term volume regulatory processes in a variety of excitable tissues. {\textcopyright} The Physiological Society 2004.},

Numerical solutions have been obtained in both the steady-state and time-varying cases for transport equations that are physically and phenomenologically reasonable. In addition to numerical solutions, analytic expressions are presented that show the ranges of membrane parameters essential for volume regulation; for values of membrane parameters beyond explicitly defined bounds, the equations do not have real, positive solutions for cell volume.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In addition to the Na, K-pump, fixed charges on the membrane surfaces are taken into account. The equation determining the resting potential in the causal theory suggests a new explanation of the genesis of the resting potential. The usual criterion for an ion pump to be electrogenic is not relevant for the whole of the resting potential, and may therefore be misleading. The physical meaning of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz formula for the membrane potential as a diffusion potential is also explained and tested with numbers for the giant axon of the squid. A significant discrepancy between theory and experiment is found which calls for an experimental re-examination of the constitutive equations for passive potassium and sodium currents. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Even though cellular volume dynamics has been linked to cell apoptosis and intrinsic optical signals, there is no quantitative model for describing neuronal volume dynamics on the millisecond time scale. This study introduces a multiphysics neuron model, where the cell volume is a time-varying variable and multiple physical principles are combined to build governing equations. Using this model, we analyzed neuronal volume responses during excitation, which elucidated the variety of optical signals observed experimentally across the literature. Several physiological conditions were examined to investigate their effect on the pattern of volume response. In addition, we analyzed volume responses on a longer time scale with repetitive stimulation to study the characteristics of slow cell swelling. This multiscale analysis of the multiphysics model will provide not only a novel quantitative elucidation of physiologically important issues related with cellular volume dynamics but also a chance for further studies, such as the interesting possibility of inferring the balance of ion flux from plateau volume changes. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to contribute to understanding the role of Na+-K+ATPase and of ionic cotransporters in the regulation of cell volume, by employing a model that describes the rates of change of the intracellular concentrations of Na+, K+, and Cl-, of the cell volume, and of the membrane potential. In most previous models of dynamic cellular phenomena, Na+K+-ATPase is incorporated via phenomenological formulations; the enzyme is incorporated here via an explicit kinetic scheme. Another feature of the present model is the capability to perform short-term cell volume regulation mediated by cotransporters of KCl and NaCl. The model is employed to perform numerical simulations for a 'typical' nonpolarized animal cell. Basically, the results are consistent with the view that the Na+ pump mainly plays a long-term role in the maintenance of the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ and that short-term cell volume regulation is achieved via passive transport, exemplified in this case by the cotransport of KCl and NaCl.},

abstract = {Changes in membrane voltage brought about by ion fluxes through voltage and transmitter-gated channels represent the basis of neural activity. As such, electrochemical gradients across the membrane determine the direction and driving force for the flow of ions and are therefore crucial in setting the properties of synaptic transmission and signal propagation. Ion concentration gradients are established by a variety of mechanisms, including specialized transporter proteins. However, transmembrane gradients can be affected by ionic fluxes through channels during periods of elevated neural activity, which in turn are predicted to influence the properties of on-going synaptic transmission. Such activity-induced changes to ion concentration gradients are a feature of both physiological and pathological neural processes. An epileptic seizure is an example of severely perturbed neural activity, which is accompanied by pronounced changes in intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations. Appreciating the factors that contribute to these ion dynamics is critical if we are to understand how a seizure event evolves and is sustained and terminated by neural tissue. Indeed, this issue is of significant clinical importance as status epilepticus—a type of seizure that does not stop of its own accord—is a life-threatening medical emergency. In this review we explore how the transmembrane concentration gradient of the six major ions (K+, Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, H+and HCO-3) is altered during an epileptic seizure. We will first examine each ion individually, before describing how multiple interacting mechanisms between ions might contribute to concentration changes and whether these act to prolong or terminate epileptic activity. In doing so, we will consider how the availability of experimental techniques has both advanced and restricted our ability to study these phenomena.},

abstract = {GABA is the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult central nervous system, but in some circumstances can lead to a paradoxical excitation that has been causally implicated in diverse pathologies from endocrine stress responses to diseases of excitability including neuropathic pain and temporal lobe epilepsy. We undertook a computational modeling approach to determine plausible ionic mechanisms of GABAA-dependent excitation in isolated post-synaptic CA1 hippocampal neurons because it may constitute a trigger for pathological synchronous epileptiform discharge. In particular, the interplay intracellular chloride accumulation via the GABAA receptor and extracellular potassium accumulation via the K/Cl co-transporter KCC2 in promoting GABAA-mediated excitation is complex. Experimentally it is difficult to determine the ionic mechanisms of depolarizing current since potassium transients are challenging to isolate pharmacologically and much GABA signaling occurs in small, difficult to measure, dendritic compartments. To address this problem and determine plausible ionic mechanisms of GABAA-mediated excitation, we built a detailed biophysically realistic model of the CA1 pyramidal neuron that includes processes critical for ion homeostasis. Our results suggest that in dendritic compartments, but not in the somatic compartments, chloride buildup is sufficient to cause dramatic depolarization of the GABAA reversal potential and dominating bicarbonate currents that provide a substantial current source to drive whole-cell depolarization. The model simulations predict that extracellular K+ transients can augment GABAA-mediated excitation, but not cause it. Our model also suggests the potential for GABAA-mediated excitation to promote network synchrony depending on interneuron synapse location - excitatory positive-feedback can occur when interneurons synapse onto distal dendritic compartments, while interneurons projecting to the perisomatic region will cause inhibition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lewin et al.},

abstract = {In the adult brain, chloride (Cl-) influx through GABA A receptors is an important mechanism of synaptic inhibition. However, under a variety of circumstances, including acquired epilepsy, neuropathic pain, after trains of action potentials or trauma, and during normal early brain development, GABAA receptor activation excites neurons by gating Cl- efflux because the intracellular Cl- concentration (Cli ) is elevated. These findings require an inducible, active mechanism of chloride accumulation. We used gramicidin-perforated patch recordings to characterize Cl- transport via NKCC1, the principal neuronal Cl- accumulator, in neonatal CA1 pyramidal neurons. NKCC1 activity was required to maintain elevated Cl i such that GABAA receptor activation was depolarizing. Kinetic analysis of NKCC1 revealed reversible transmembrane Cl- transport characterized by a large maximum velocity (vmax) and high affinity (Km), so that NKCC1 transport was limited only by the net electrochemical driving force for Na+, K+, and Cl -. At the steady-state Cli , NKCC1 was at thermodynamic equilibrium, and there was no evidence of net Cl- transport. Trains of action potentials that have been previously shown to induce persistent changes in neuronal ECl (reversal potential for Cl-) did not alter vmax or Km of NKCC1. Rather, action potentials shifted the thermodynamic set point, the steady-state Cli at which there was no net NKCC1-mediated Cl- transport. The persistent increase in Cli required intact $\alpha$2/$\alpha$3 Na +-K+-ATPase activity, indicating that trains of action potentials reset the thermodynamic equilibrium for NKCC1 transport by lowering Nai. Activity-induced changes in Na+-K+-ATPase activity comprise a novel mechanism for persistent alterations in synaptic signaling mediated by GABA.

abstract = {Chloride homeostasis is a critical determinant of the strength and robustness of inhibition mediated by GABA A receptors (GABA ARs). The impact of changes in steady state Cl - gradient is relatively straightforward to understand, but how dynamic interplay between Cl - influx, diffusion, extrusion and interaction with other ion species affects synaptic signaling remains uncertain. Here we used electrodiffusion modeling to investigate the nonlinear interactions between these processes. Results demonstrate that diffusion is crucial for redistributing intracellular Cl - load on a fast time scale, whereas Cl -extrusion controls steady state levels. Interaction between diffusion and extrusion can result in a somato-dendritic Cl - gradient even when KCC2 is distributed uniformly across the cell. Reducing KCC2 activity led to decreased efficacy of GABA AR-mediated inhibition, but increasing GABA AR input failed to fully compensate for this form of disinhibition because of activity-dependent accumulation of Cl -. Furthermore, if spiking persisted despite the presence of GABA AR input, Cl - accumulation became accelerated because of the large Cl - driving force that occurs during spikes. The resulting positive feedback loop caused catastrophic failure of inhibition. Simulations also revealed other feedback loops, such as competition between Cl - and pH regulation. Several model predictions were tested and confirmed by [Cl -] i imaging experiments. Our study has thus uncovered how Cl - regulation depends on a multiplicity of dynamically interacting mechanisms. Furthermore, the model revealed that enhancing KCC2 activity beyond normal levels did not negatively impact firing frequency or cause overt extracellular K - accumulation, demonstrating that enhancing KCC2 activity is a valid strategy for therapeutic intervention. {\textcopyright} 2011 Doyon et al.},
